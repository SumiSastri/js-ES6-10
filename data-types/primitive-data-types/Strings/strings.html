	<h5>Open console for demo of interpolation & template literals</h5>
	<p>A string is a primitive data-type in JavaScript. They are held in single or double quotes.  Strings values can hold text, letters, numbers, symbols, punctuation,emojis - so long as they are in quotes JavaScript will recognise the value in quotes as a string type.

		String literals are immutable i.e they can't be altered once created. 
		<p>
		A string is also JavaScript constructor method. Under-the-hood, it is an object with its own inbuilt methods or functions. 
		
		This can create confusion as the type of a string literal <em>"Hello world" </em>is not identical to the type of the String object <em>new String('Hello world')</em>. This sometimes enforces unnecessary and confusing typechecks. Typescript was created as a JavaScript superscript to enforce these type checks.
	</p>
		String literals behave like an array held within quotes and thefore are iterable and several array methods can be used.</p>
	

	<p>Template literals allow you to use backticks to print strings. The dollar and curly braces help you turn a javascript argument into a string.</p>
