	<p>Numbers are a primitive data type in JavaScript.Not a number is a property of the window object. In modern browsers it is non-configurable and not used as a property that you can write into code. It is usually an error message when a math operation fails.Null, NaN and Infinity are separate data-types from numbers. Null does not represent 0 in JavaScript but the absence of an object. As all JavaScript data types are objects, to represent the deliberate absence of an object null is used to prevent an error message of undefined.Without a default parameter this function will return undefined and NaN</p>
