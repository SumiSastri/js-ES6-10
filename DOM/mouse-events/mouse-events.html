  <h5>JAVASCRIPT MOUSE EVENTS DEMO</h5>
  <div>
    <p>Mouse events are fired when the mouse is moved<br>
    They are call-back functions & like click-events.<br>
    Factory functions are written in the JavaScript files<br>
    Here mouse-enter, mouse-leave have call-back functions that change the background color of the body as the mouse changes position over the screen.
