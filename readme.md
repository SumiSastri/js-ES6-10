# History of JavaScript

Created by Brenden Eich in 1996, JavaScript was written for Netscape under the name Mocha, then changed to  "LiveScript". Microsoft renamed LiveScript for Explorer calling it JScript, or JavaScript. Standardising JavaScript fell to the hands of ECMA and JavaScript is also known as ECMA Script or ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8 and ES9 which are are updated versions of JavaScript.

## What is JavaScript

"JavaScript" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States. It is used under licenseby Mozilla and in JS-engines in browsers - V8(Google), Chakra(Microsoft), SpiderMonkey(Firefox). JavaScript is officially managed by Mozilla Foundation, and new language features are added periodically. However, only some JavaScript engines support these new features.

As a programming language, JavaScript is a dynamic and loosely typed script. It is read (parsed) by JavaScript engines in browsers and node modules in the backend. It needs a hosting environment as it is DOM and Node dependent. JavaScript has no concept of input or output. To enforce structure on JavaScript, Typescript, a JavaScript superscript defines types as inputs or outputs.

JavaScript is considered a non-blocking, single-threaded language because of this lack of a sense of input-output. Instead events and call-back functions in the event loop handle changes to inputs and outputs. In the front-end where users interact with an application, inputs such as clicks, mouse movements, keypad movements are "listened" to and "handled" by callback functions. The asynchronous nature of these callback functions means that several inputs can be handled simultaneously, and therefore,a single thread can handle multiple requests in a task queue, making the language non-blocking.

Known as JS as well as Vanilla JavaScript - refering to JS without frameworks or libraries, JavaScript is now one of the most popular scripting languages.

JavaScript is almost entirely object-based. In JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype using classes & constructors for inheritance of the values, properties and methods associated with the class.

JavaScript uses prototypes where other programming languages use classes. Classes were introduced in ES5. This allows libraries like React to use class-based components, based on the Model-View-Control process which is different from DOM-based manipulation of HTML files.

A model of the DOM, or the virtual-DOM is created.

## What is ECMA-6-10 or ES-6-10

The European Computer Manufacturers Association or ECMA update and standardize JavaScript introducing new features that are cross-browser friendly. ES-5 is the last version of JavaScript that is cross-browser friendly. The new features from ES-6 onwards need Babel and other libraries to transpile code into ES-5.
