Iterations or loops can be performed over iterable objects:-
- Strings
- Arrays
- Maps (maps are key-value pairs that look like an object but are ordered collections so you can iterate over them, they are a new type in ES-6). Map has its own methods. ```Map.set()``` it also has a size property
- Sets
