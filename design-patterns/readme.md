This section breaks down common design patterns for basic utilisation of arrays as a data-type and the higher-order-functions like map, filter and reduce that can be used on both arrays and objects.

Conditionals and iterations review logic and loops over arrays & objects. Higher-order-functions are basically iterations.

The section on object-oriented-programming explores how classes and constructors are used in vanilla JavaScript. Classes in JavaScript are not strictly considered a design pattern.
