// WHILE LOOP 2:10
// while loop checks if the condition is true
// while this conditon is true, code block performed
// if false stops, or does not execute at all

// here the code says while i is 0, and i is less than 100
// add one to the previous number - here the answer is 9
var i = 0;
count = 10;
while (i < count){
   i++;
}
console.log(count)

// if you change the condition to greater or equal to count
// the answer will be 10
var i = 0;
count = 10;
while (i <= count){
   i++;
}
console.log(count)
